# My Board

A drag-and-drop app that also features background-changing options.

- **[Project Live Link](https://my-board-two.vercel.app/)**

## Features

- **Drag and Drop**: Organize items with ease.
- **Background Changing**: Change the background of the board using background colors or free images from Unsplash.

## Note

- This is not a mobile-friendly app.
- There is no backend connected, so data won't be saved.

## How It Works

- The app utilizes the **Unsplash API** for fetching free images that can be used to change the background of the board.
- To get started, you'll need to replace `VITE_UNSPLASH_CLIENT_KEY` in your `.env` file with your own Unsplash API key.
